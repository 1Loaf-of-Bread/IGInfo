# IGInfo

IGInfo is used for anything to do with [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/). So far you can collect information on accounts and download public account posts with IGInfo-Public.py
You can also download all of your saved posts from instagram too by using IGInfo-saved.py

IGInfo-Public is not capable of grabbing info on accounts that are privated, this program does not require sigining into your account.

IGInfo-Saved is used for downloading your saved posts, this program requires sigining into your account.

Use the argument -h while executing either script for more detail.
